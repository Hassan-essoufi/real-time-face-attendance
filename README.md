# 🎥 Real-Time Face Recognition System for Automated Attendance

This project implements a **real-time and video-based face recognition & attendance system** using **FaceNet**, **MTCNN**, **OpenCV**, and **cosine similarity**. It supports both **live webcam recognition** and **offline video detection**, designed for **classroom attendance, recorded sessions, and surveillance-style analysis**.

## 🚀 Features

* 📸 Face detection using **MTCNN** 
* 🧠 Face embedding extraction with **FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1)**
* 📐 Identity matching using **cosine similarity**
* 🎥 **Real-time webcam recognition**
* 🎞️ **Video file face recognition** (MP4, AVI, etc.)
* 🗂️ Embedding database built automatically from a dataset
* 🧾 Attendance export to **CSV** with timestamp
* ❓ Unknown face handling

## 🧠 System Workflow (Real-Time & Video)

1. Build a face **embedding database** from labeled images
2. Capture frames from **webcam or video file**
3. Detect faces in each frame using **MTCNN**
4. Extract embeddings using **FaceNet**
5. Compare embeddings using **cosine similarity**
6. Assign identity if cosine similarity ≥ threshold
7. Mark attendance and save results to csv file

## 🎬 Video Recognition Demo 

Below is a sample output video generated by the system after processing an input video. The video shows **detected faces, recognized identities, and cosine similarity scores** directly overlaid on each frame.

## 📐 Cosine Similarity & Threshold (FaceNet Embeddings)

Cosine similarity measures **directional similarity** between embeddings:

* Range: `[-1, 1]`
* Higher = more similar

Typical threshold:

```
0.75 – 0.85
```

* Too low → false positives
* Too high → missed recognitions
